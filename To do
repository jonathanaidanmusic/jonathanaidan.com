# TODO
- Look into exporting social icons as SVG from photoshop
- Look into possibly mocking up a site design from screenshot of site at present
- Review Bootstrap Components to get a feel for possible plug-and-play designs
- Look into screen captures from videos and export png versions (we'll need 3 versions for each: Desktop, Tablet, Phone)
